	"1" : "A mysterious stranger wants some non-disclosed cargo delivered to [destination]. The boxes are tightly sealed but are marked with a strange symbol that feels familiar.",
	"2" : "Another anonymous contract. This one does not specify a cargo however. Just to make 'as much noise and damage as possible' on the way up to [destination]. Empty dummy crates are provided to give a launch excuse to the company.",
	"3" : "Once more a contract from an unkown source. The tumult resulting from your first mysterious contract has begun to fade. Time for another 'charged' delivery. This time to [destination].",
	"4" : "Another anonymous contract, this time for hauling lots of posters to [destination]. However, you could swear you heard a cough coming from one of the heavier crates. This contract has a note attached: 'Hello [username], you have helped us in the past and we presume you loyal enough to our cause that we reveal our organisation identity. We are the [revolutionists] and aim to abolish the upper-classes, bringing them back down to earth. First we need to increase our influence up there. Then we bring it all down. Together.'",
	"5" : "Once again a anonymous contract with an attached note: 'The end is coming close my friend, we just need to remove one more hurdle before the climax. This contract is a delivery of some very expensive wine known to be the favorite of one of the local billionaires of [destination]. This particular vintage is a littler spicier than usual though. Do our disgustingly rich benefactor in space a favor and deliver the wine.'",
	"6" : "One last contract from [revolutionists]. This contract was injected directly into the Elysium ticket system. By accepting this contract you will buy a ticket and deliver a powerful explosive to Elysium and destroy the Capitalists holding the chains of humanity and whats left of earth.",
